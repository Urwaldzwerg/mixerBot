# What is this?

This is a **prototype** of a notification bot for Microsofts streaming platform called Mixer, using it's [Constellation API] (https://dev.mixer.com/reference/constellation/introduction).

## What can it do?

Currently this bot **somewhat supports** some basic events such as Follows, Sparks, Hosts, Subscriptions and Skills

## What will it be able to do?

The end goal of this bot is to make some flashy light animations using RGB LED strips whenever one of the events occurs. Possibly in the future this bot will also utillize some sort of display to show some graphics whenever a event occurs.

## Why do you want something that does that?

Well - streaming is all about audience interaction. Having the streamers environment react to what the viewers are doing is, in my opinion, a very nice to have passive level of interaction.
